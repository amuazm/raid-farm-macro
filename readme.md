You need AutoHotkey installed.

1. You must be ready to run it - Minecraft open, bad omen, sword and food in hand, looking at the correct angles, positioned properly, lever flicked such that the spawning platform is flooded
2. Run script.ahk
3. Press "Yes" when it is at the correct window (your Minecraft window)
4. Press `Ctrl + N` to start the macro. You can tab out and do other things. Make sure that your Minecraft tab is minimised, not just out of focus, if you want to multi-task
5. Press `Ctrl + N` again to stop the macro by reloading the script
6. Click "No" to the window finder to close the script entirely

Even though this should theoretically allow you to AFK forever, you run this at your own risk. There are a lot of factors at play and you might die (in Minecraft) while running this script.
